MyCupboard is a personal project I took on to try and learn some GUI stuff in Tkinter.
You enter ingredients that you currently have, and then search its database for recipes
you can make.

run with python mc.py

note: current database contains only 50 recipes. 

#todo implement web scraper to populate recipe db from popular recipe sites
#todo add functionality so user can enter their applicances/cookware
#todo improve spell-checking/replacements
